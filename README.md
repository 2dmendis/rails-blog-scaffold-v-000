## Instructions

This is a simple lab. All you have to do is get the tests passing. There are a bunch of tests, but it should take you less than 5 minutes to finish this lab. Try to figure out the one command you need to run to make the entire suite pass. **Read the Controller and Views specs for help on figuring out this one command.** Try running rspec. You'll most likely get an error. You'll need to also remember to migrate your test database, but rspec will clue you in. Browse the code, read, try to take it all in.

## What are all these files?

All the files that you currently see in your project directory, with the exception of a few `spec` files, were generated via the `rails new` command. Consequently, it built a fully-fledged web app ready out of the box. This is an example of why the Rails framework is called an opinionated framework that favors convention over configuration. With Sinatra, we can build an app from scratch, by just `require  'sinatra'` in a file and calling `rackup`. Rails is much heavier than that. With an app ready out of the box through generators like `rails new` and `rails generate scaffold`, we're able to build powerful applications very quickly.
